## Admin Page Debug Info Added:

I've added console logging to help debug the admin page issue:
- Check browser console (F12) to see what's happening
- Logs will show if products are loading
- Logs will show if table is rendering

**To check:**
1. Open admin page
2. Press F12 to open browser console
3. Look for messages like:
   - "Admin page loaded"
   - "Products available: true"
   - "Number of products: 140"
   - "loadProducts called"
   - "Products displayed"

If you see error messages, please share them so I can fix the issue!
