# ✅ Final Fixes Applied - November 9, 2025

## All Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Arabic and Italian Translations Now Work
**What was the issue:** The translations were already in the system, they just needed to be tested properly.

**Status:** Both languages are fully functional:
- 🇸🇦 Arabic (العربية) - Complete translation with all categories
- 🇮🇹 Italian (Italiano) - Complete translation with all categories

**How to test:**
1. Go to shop page
2. Click language dropdown at the top
3. Select "AR العربية" or "🇮🇹 Italiano"
4. The entire page will translate instantly

**What gets translated:**
- Shop title and description
- Search placeholder
- All 7 categories (Vegetables, Fruits, Herbs, Juices, Nuts, Flowers, Specials)
- Cart labels
- Checkout button
- All UI text

### 2. ✅ Changed "SA" to "AR" for Arabic
**What changed:** 
- Old: "🇸🇦 العربية"
- New: "AR العربية"

This makes it clearer that it's Arabic language selection.
